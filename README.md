# Zemoga UI Test

Exercise accomplished with HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, Webpack, ReactJS, Cypress, NodeJS.

The test was completed for Frontend, but due to time availability I decided to create a simple API that connects to a Database in mongoDB providing the corresponding information.
It consists of three branches: Interactive, Layout, Backend.

## Building and running on localhost Interactive Branch.

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```


## Building and running on localhost Backend Branch.

Create .env file with the following credential:
```sh
DB_URL=mongodb+srv://db_user_RuleOfThumb:QunPnz8zKZQWkvyd@cluster0.wmxbx.mongodb.net/test
```

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

It was decided to use native CSS, in order to show skill with the native tool, which triggered challenges such as logic depending on the element to be displayed.
